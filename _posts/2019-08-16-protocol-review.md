# Protocol Review
## Making  slides
* The title slide could have the title, PI, department, stat collaborator, *phase*, sponsor, *design*, accrual (total and per month), *treatment*, and *DSMB status*. Italicized items are more optional.
* In total you probably want at least 7-8 slides, more is ok. There should be a Background, Objectives, Specific Aims, Study Population, Study Design, Statistical Design, Major/Minor Concerns + Comments.
* Pictures are nice, just copy and paste theirs.
* Copy and paste some of their operating characterics tables if given.

## Watch out for
* Check their power/sample size calculations.
* Null or alternative hypotheses that don't appear to match what they want.
* Too much multiplicity.

# Things you can include in protocol
## Always
* Descriptive statistics
  * i.e. calculate mean and standard deviation of circulating biomarkers or body composition
* Power simulations
* Explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria

## Sometimes
* Interim analysis
* FDR or other adjustment for multiplicity
* Toxicity monitoring
* Waitlist control design - allow the "less desireable" control group to switch to the intervention after study ends.
* If it's a feasibility aim - only need to calculate percentage eligibility, adherence, retention.
  * Make confidence intervals, get the mean and SD, calculate power.
  * "If the true adherence is 85%, we will have 91% power to create a 95% confidence interval that is located to the right of 0.8."
* Software used for randomization
* t-tests and linear regression always welcome
* Tables for early stopping percentage, accept null percentage, reject null percentage
* Sensitivity analysis
* Dose escalcation - 3+3 design
* Wilcoxon test for data that is not normally distributed at population level, Fisher's exact test for categorial data, log-rank test for time to event
