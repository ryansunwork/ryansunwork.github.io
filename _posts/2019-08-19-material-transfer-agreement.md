To submit an MTA request:

1. Request access to the eResearch MTA portal at oneaccess.mdanderson.org.
  * As Carolina Kurnava or somebody else at Office of Research Administration for directions (Aug 12 2019 email)
2. Go to the new request portal at https://eresearchmta.mdanderson.edu/MTA.
3. Click on New Material Transfer.
4. You will have to upload a draft MTA from the people giving you the data. You will also have to let MDA know if you got IRB approval and/or an approval letter from the people giving you the data. You will have to fill out some basic questions about the purpose of the data and if it is being combined (more work). You will have to give conflicts of interest.
5. Then save and submit it for approval.
6. The signing official you need to give to the other party is Nyma Shah.
7. Wait.
