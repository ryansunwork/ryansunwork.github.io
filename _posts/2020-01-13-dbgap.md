# Data Application
You will need to log into dbGaP with your eRA account and fill out a few short questions. There is a Research Use Statement (mine was 276 word or 1851 characters), a Cloud Use Statement, and a Non-Technical Summary (both about the same length). The signing official was Amy Moritz and the IT Director was Lee Andrews (Director, Oncology Care and Research Information Systems; 713-745-4071; llandrews@mdanderson.org)

Concurrently (or before), you have to go into the MD Anderson MTA website and answer the MTA questions. It may take a couple weeks (or more) for them to review. 

# Download
Once permission is granted, you have to first download the SRA toolkit [here](https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi?view=software). Then see the part about configuring the toolkit at the bottom of the page [here](https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi?view=toolkit_doc&f=std#s-4). It basically just sets the home directory for your downloads.

For setting up the SRA toolkit, you'll need your dbGaP respository key (just once then you can delete it and redownload when needed). Log in to dbGaP [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap/), click the "My Projects" tab, and you'll see "get dbGaP respository key" under Actions.

Now go to the dbGaP homepage again and click "dbGaP Data Browser" under "Resources." It will take you to your "Authorized Access" page. Click on the "My Requests" tab and then click "Request Files" and then "dbGaP File Selector."

Check all the boxes in the table that correspond to the files you want to download and then hit the green "Cart file" button. This will download a kart file with the .krt extension.

There is a binary called prefetch in the bin folder of your downloaded SRA toolkit. First navigate to the ncbi directory that was created when you set up SRA (it should be something like /Users/rsun3/ncbi, and inside there is a folder for each project). From the ncbi root directory, run /path/to/prefetch/prefetch -X 200G /path/to/kartfile/FILENAME.krt. Here -X 200G increases the maximum size of download to 200G (or more). You can also see [here](https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/sra.cgi?view=toolkit_doc&f=prefetch) for help.

For large downloads you may need to download Aspera from [here](https://downloads.asperasoft.com/downloads). Look for "aspera client" and follow the prompts. Aspera should run automatically when you do prefetch if you have it installed. It does not need to be installed to run prefetch.

To decrypt the data, you will need the vdb-decrypt binary in your SRA toolkit. The command is /path/top/vdb/vdb-decrypt /path/to/project/directory, where the project directory is the one directly under the ncbi directory. More information is [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK63512/#Download.are_downloaded_files_encrypted).
